# Tornado Cash: Lord of Mixers
#### Published July, 2022

## Introduction 
Just as rats choose cocaine, digital money launderers are hooked onto Tornado Cash– undeniably warranting the questions: What is Tornado Cash and Why is it Legal? Read on to find out. 

More than $1 Billion in crypto has been lost to scams since the beginning of 2021, according to the Federal Trade Commission. 
Although cryptocurrencies have been a haven for nefarious activities right from its inception, the introduction of Cryptocurrency Mixers has exacerbated the issue. 
Where the award for most popular of such mixers going to Tornado Cash.

In true “1984” Orwellian fashion, blockchain accrues its top-notch security from the around the clock capability to monitor the chain’s ledger. 
So traditionally, money laundering through cryptocurrency was out of the question as transactions of any wallet address were easily trackable. 
Up until the creation of cryptocurrency mixers. Born was the new way of funneling crypto through a pool filled with funds of various other users, in order to obfuscate the transactional trail.

## How Do Crypto Mixers Work?
Essentially, Person A deposits their crypto into a ‘mixer’, which is nothing but a large pool of currencies, and Person B later withdraws the deposited amount of crypto.

The crypto withdrawn is not the same as the original deposited as it gets tumbled or shuffled with funds of various other individuals. 
This breaks the direct on-chain link between Person A and Person B from ever being created. Person A could just as easily assume the role of Person B and completely obscure the transfer of funds from the source wallet address to a new destination address. 

Thus, mixers have become the typical first destination for thieves to launder their loot. 

## What Makes Torndo.cash Differrent? 
Cryptocurrency mixers have been around since the early days of bitcoin but the early providers of mixing services were custodial. This meant that they held users’ funds, making them money transmitters under the scrutiny of government authorities. One of the first major cryptocurrency mixers, Helix, moved over 350,000 bitcoin – valued at over $300 million at the time of operation between 2014-2017. Its operator Larry Harmon pleaded guilty to money laundering and agreed to forfeit 4,400 bitcoin last year as well as a slap of $60 million fine from the Department of Treasury. 
However, Tornado cash differentiates itself by being a decentralized app on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts fuel tornado cash, enabling the service to operate completely autonomously. The protocols developers have even gone to the extent of burning the cryptographic keys that allowed them to access and modify the smart contract. As a result, the mixing service has become a ‘perpetually self-executing code’ running on the ethereum network, which can only be stopped by halting the blockchain itself. 

Tornado cash is a smart contract system that allows users to deposit fixed denominations of Ethereum and in return receive  a cryptographically secure note containing a secret key generated at random. Zero-knowledge cryptography secures the generation of the note, preventing any link to the depositing transaction. The note acts as a voucher certifying the users deposited Ethereum, concurrently triggering the smart contract to release funds once the destination  wallet address is provided. Nothing more than the note is required to withdraw the shuffled Ethereum from the smart contract.. 

Simple, Straightforward, Trustless means of money laundering.

## Mixed Legality
So you might be wondering why this service exists besides expediting illicit transactions?

We explored the arguments endorsing tornado cash and similar protocols, two legitimate reasons stand out. First, many consider these protocols to be merely exercising their freedom of speech as they are simply Github repositories. Secondly, a more legitimate argument arises in the case of high-net-worth wallet addresses and their ability to mask themselves from becoming targets for hackers and scammers.
However, of the 3.2 million ETH (roughly $3.5 billion) that has been deposited in the service since its launch, more than more than $1 billion—almost a third of all the funds—has been reportedly laundered through the protocol (report by blockchain cybersecurity firm Elliptic). 

Why doesn't the government block Tornado Cash?
Well it isn't as simple as it sounds. As mentioned earlier, Tornado cash operates completely autonomously as a self-executing code on the Ethereum blockchain. Even if law enforcement takes down the domain, the protocol can be accessed directly with an Ethereum Name Service(ENS). By chance if the protocol is somehow tampered with, the code is open-source and available to everyone through Github, allowing anyone to replicate the protocol. 

Ergo, Tornado cash has become an unstoppable force of nature, slipping away from the grasp of authorities while upholding the true libertarian ideals of cryptocurrency.
