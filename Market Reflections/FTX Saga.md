# Crypto’s Biggest Scam: The FTX- SBF Implosion 

### Introduction
After the dramatic collapse of ‘Crypto’s Golden boy’, Altruistic Vegan Billionaire, Sam Bankman-Fried, US senators resonated sentiments around the world with a letter that read: 
“FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made it abundantly clear that the digital asset industry has serious problems. 
The industry is full of charismatic wunderkinds, opportunistic fraudsters and self-proclaimed investment advisers promoting financial products with little to no transparency."

With his incredible act of misdirection, some say on par with the proficiency of Penn & Teller, FTX Chief Executive ‘SBF’ made $10.4 Billion of customer funds disappear into thin air. 
FTX, the second largest crypto-exchange at one point, fell to its demise after these funds were siphoned to make risky bets through its subsidiary trading firm Alameda Research.
Once the ponzi scheme was unmasked, not only did SBF’s billion dollar fortune collapse, but unfortunately it brought down along with it the whole crypto market. 
The crash has had wide-reaching implications that are still being felt everyday.

### How it started:
Silicon-valley born, MIT graduate Sam Bankman-Fried(SBF) launched his crypto-trading firm Alameda research in 2017 after a two-year stint working as a trader dabbling in derivatives, & currencies at New York-Based Jane Street Capital, a quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider. 
He quickly rose up the ladder of fame and fortune through his knack for arbitrage. 
He realised that he was able to get bitcoin cheap in the U.S and sell high in the Japanese markets and subsequently went on to exploit it with his own trading firm.

Two-years after he set up AlamedaResearch, SBF went onto launching the FTX exchange with his team. 
FTX saw great traction with its perks of low fees and advanced options for experienced traders. FTX and Alameda grew exponentially reporting profits of $350 million and $1 Billion respectively in 2020 alone. 

SBF as “Crypto’s Golden boy” grabbed the attention of the world’s top VCs and hedge funds eager to get in on the Bitcoin boom. 
In the bull run of 2021, FTX raised over $1.4Billion at a $25mn valuation. 
As early as the beginning of this year, Softbank and Temasek Holdings funded FTX with another $400mn bumping the valuation up to a whopping $32 Billion valuation.

The meteoric rise of FTX within three years fetched the world’s biggest celebrities as its promoters and advocates. From NBA stars like Lebron James and Steph Curry to Katy Perry and American football legend Tom Brady, all of whom helped SBF become a well revered face all across the crypto & financial sectors. 
FTX even became the largest funder of the Biden Campaign, contributing nearly $40mn to Democrats who were “crypto-friendly” at the primaries, according to OpenSecrets.org.

### How it all went wrong:   
In early November, CoinDesk released a ticking time bomb of a report which questioned the stability of Mr. Bankman’s entire empire. The article breaks down a certain balance sheet of Alameda Research which indicated that Alameda’s assets were mostly tied up in FTT, a token invented by FTX.
Alameda held the lion's share of FTT marking up the total value held as $5.5Billion, according to the leaked document. 
There seemed to be an unusual dependency between FTX and Alameda. 
The billions of FTT in its balance sheet gave Alameda immense powers as it could post the stash of FTT as collateral and borrow other coins to fund its risky trading strategies. 
Not a great strategy if the market was to ever move against FTT. 
The co-dependency between Alameda-FTX and FTT gave an opening for market movers always in search of lucrative opportunities. 
The market sentiment quickly changed with exchanges filling up with positions against FTT. 

Just a couple days later things started to look even murkier as Changpeng "CZ" Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of FTX’s early investors and arguably its chief competitor, entered the scene. Earlier in July, Binance swapped its stake in FTX for a bulk of FTT tokens and stablecoins. Referring to the revelations from the CoinDesk report, “CZ” in a tweet divulged their intention of liquidating every last remaining FTT token on their balance sheet- which turned out to be worth more than $530 million- sending the whole market into a frenzy. 

Over the next couple of days FTX faced a major bank run as customers raced to pull out funds. Withdrawals reached over $6 Billion which the exchange struggled to fulfill. FTT plunged 32% in under 72 hours and continued its slump until SBF came out with a surprise announcement. He claimed Binance had struck a deal to acquire FTX, in-turn bailing them out. However, as a kick to the groin, Binance pulled out of the deal citing issues after due diligence such as “mishandled customer funds” and “alleged U.S. agency investigations”. Consequently the FTT token took a nosedive and along with it billions got wiped out from SBF’s net worth overnight.  

A full accounting of what went wrong at FTX is likely months away, but a reconstruction of what the firm did shows that FTX loaned over $8 Billion of customer funds to Alameda which in turn invested it in illiquid assets. Subsequently when FTX’s customers riled up orders of withdrawals, it couldn't be fulfilled. 


### The Aftermath: 
In the next 48 hours, FTX and Alameda Research along with its 130 affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, cutting off any remaining hope for their line of creditors and investors. 
Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as the CEO of FTX giving way to John Ray, who led Enron in bankruptcy. 

Rubbing salt to the wound of its investors and users, just as FTX filed for bankruptcy, it was hit with an apparent $400mn exploit draining funds from the exchange. 
While it still remains unclear whether the hack was an inside job, what became morbidly clear is FTX’s abysmal management of customer funds and its cold wallets. 
The executive brought in to guide Mr. Bankman-Fried’s companies through bankruptcy said the state of FTX’s affairs was the biggest mess he had seen in his decades long career which includes unwinding one of -if not- the biggest accounting scandal being Enron Corp. 

### The Domino Effect: 
The contagion of FTX’s demise was destined to be felt across the market as it was one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms by sheer volume. 
Its cataclysmic downfall created a ripple effect hurting projects not only affiliated to SBF, FTX and Alameda but also the whole crypto industry. 

As FTT fell it drastically weakened the prices of BTC and ETH, and subsequently led to the fall of the whole market. 
It sent the total value of the sector down by 12% over the course of a day, as per CoinDesk.

The biggest impact among Cryptocurrencies was revealed with a 54% drop in the price of Solana. The $Sol token was hit the hardest as Alameda Research was one of its ICO investors in 2021, and was supposedly holding billions worth of staked and unstaked Solana. 
The FTX collapse had struck just as Solana was finally finding its footing after a year of multiple exploits on its blockchain. 
Solana’s immense ties with FTX and SBF, coupled with the harsh crypto winter saw its Total Value Locked (TVL) plunge 70% to $303M. 

Cryptocurrencies weren't the only ones to face the scrutiny of FTX’s mishaps. Various protocols and crypto firms have started to report their exposure to FTX. 
Blockfi being the frontrunner filing for Bankruptcy protection following in the footsteps of FTX. 
This doesn't come as a surprise as their financial troubles began earlier this year as they were at the brink of liquidation only to be buoyed by a $400mn line of credit offered by FTX. 

FTX mimicking its former CEO SBF, acted through a facade of altruism when agreeing to this deal. Their principal intention was to prevent the tanking of its FTT token as BlockFi held millions of it which was subsequently about to hit the market if they were to be liquidated.  
Another crypto firm Voyager had also received an ostensible buyout from FTX earlier this year after facing the effects of the crypto slump. 
Voyager put itself back on auction after the FTX implosion. 

The FTX meltdown undoubtedly damaged crypto and traditional VCs who had encouraged FTX in its insatiable rounds of funding. The Silicon Valley VC Sequoia Capital stands to lose over $200mn that it invested in FTX’s B and B-1 seed rounds. Temasek Capital, owned by the Singapore Government, has already written down its $210mn investment to zero. The irony of this investment surfaces as Singapore had banned every other CEX in the country except FTX, curtailing competition and innovation. Karma comes to bite them in the back as they face heavy parliamentary backlash over its ties to FTX.  

Even other centralised exchanges were not spared as they witnessed withdrawals at a historic rate corresponding to holders seeking the safety of self-custody. There has been one of the largest net declines for exchanges in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in less than 7-days. California based crypto exchange Bitfront seized operations following the demise of FTX citing the move as a protective measure against the present volatile conditions of the market. 


### Current Situation:
The ongoing FTX and SBF saga continues with incriminating evidence being revealed each new day. New reports show that Sam Bankman pocketed $300million of the $420mn FTX raised during one of the funding rounds in October 2021. As FTX undergoes bankruptcy hearing at the state of Delaware, former CEO and Founder Sam Bankman-Fried lacks any sympathy for the millions who have lost their life savings on the exchange. Since the collapse has given tone-deaf interviews with big publications such as NY Times, Vox and WSJ in a vain attempt to vindicate himself from any wrongdoing. Crypto sleuths were on a mission to find his exact location in the Bahamas with multiple crowdfunded trips allowing them to do so.  Other journalists such as Coffeezilla have pressured SBF into admitting fraud on numerous occasions via Twitter spaces which the disgraced founder frequents. 

However, as The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating the collapse of FTX, Bankman-Fried’s one-time friends and co-workers Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and have turned state's evidence against SBF. 

So at last, on a rainy day, as dawn broke on 21st December in the Bahamas, SBF was taken into custody by the Bahamian officials to be extradited back to the U.S where he will face a long list of charges related to the downfall of his crypto- exchange.


### Bottomline: 
The downfall of FTX and Alameda makes a great parable for the world on the precipice of mainstream blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption. 

Evidently, the failure of FTX cannot be regarded as a failure of crypto in itself as centralised custody is the prime underlying construct that bitcoin was formed to oppose. 
The same problems resurface which was witnessed during the origin of the traditional financial system where shady business practices, bank runs, uninsured accounts and pump-and-dump scams ran rampant. But as a real eye-opener for both investors and VCs, billions invested vanished into thin air with FTX’s demise. 

An unprecedented scene as traditional custodial entities have the protection of the Central Banks of their respective countries. However, the wild-west of crypto is ruthless and unforgiving, where funds can disappear overnight without any trace or cognisance of the party accountable for the malfeasance. 

To summarize, if there's anything that this epic saga elucidates, it’s the golden rule of crypto - ‘Not your keys, Not your crypto’.
