## Introduction
For centuries, the ‘Big 3’ gemstones of rubies, sapphires and emeralds have served as portable stores of wealth, cultural opulence and collateral in private markets. Their scarcity and desirability have not just been preserved but have compounded value in multiples through generations. However, that same uniqueness has also made gemstones one of the most illiquid, opaque and exclusionary asset classes in global finance.

Today’s gemstone market is defined by three main structural frictions: High exposure barrier  that confine ownership to wealthy collectors and institutions; Lack of transparent provenance & grading that undermine price discovery; and the Absence of a scalable exchange infrastructure, which leaves sellers exposed to long sale cycles and steep discounts. Such frictions prevent gemstones from fulfilling their potential as investable, portfolio-grade assets.

A new era is emerging where gemstones can transcend these limits. For the first time, they can be accessible in fractions, traded with transparency, and integrated into modern finance. This shift doesn’t just contemporize an ancient asset class; it redefines it as a liquid, borderless, and inclusive store of value.

Once a static luxury is now poised to become a dynamic financial instrument. This transformation unlocks a future where gemstones are no longer rare to own but easy to trade, stored safely in vaults but circulating freely in digital markets. This opportunity will beget global accessibility, transparency, and liquidity.

### Gemstones Historically 
Gemstones are part of the world’s oldest commodities which have been treasured, traded and hoarded for more than 6000 years. Epochs before modern capital markets existed, coloured gemstones have carried monetary, ceremonial and symbolic importance. They have played an important role in marking dynasties, underwriting dowries, securing political alliances and serving as portable wealth for emperors and merchants. The socio-cultural history of gemstones defines its value to this day.
 
 Across cultures, coloured gemstones have been firmly embedded in rites, myths and status systems. They have acquired layers of meaning, beyond intrinsic worth, through rarity, colour and origin.

####  The Big Three: Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald

While diamonds dominate the contemporary thought, coloured gemstones, specifically the ‘Big Three’, have retained the crown of classic investment-grade precious stones. 

• Ruby - The red variety of corundum; the higher grades are rarer than diamonds. “Pigeon blood” rubies and large clear specimens command outsized premiums. 

• Sapphire - Best known in deep blue from Kashmir, yet are found in a spectrum of colors. Kashmir and Burmese (Mogok) origins have special premiums. 

• Emerald - The green beryl is prized for its color saturation, the finest Colombian of which is particularly sought-after. Clear, deeply saturated emeralds with clean colour retain value and have exhibited steady long-term growth.

#### Diamonds versus Coloured Gemstones
Diamonds are highly durable, universally recognized, and more liquid than colored gemstones. However, diamonds have concentrated productions, extensive marketing (famously exemplified by De Beers) and large existing inventories. And hence, prices of diamonds are relatively stable, devoid of outsized returns. Contradicting the average mindset, rare coloured gemstones have historically delivered larger appreciation, albeit with greater risks tied to sourcing, provenance, and pricing.


### The Investment Case - Why Gemstones Matter Today
Gemstones are increasingly being recognized as alternative financial assets to diversify portfolios right beside art, watches and investment-grade cars. They have shed the worldview as mere cultural artifacts or adornments; increasing their appeal through a unique mix of scarcity, durability and independence from broader macroeconomic cycles.

Here are the key reasons why coloured gemstones garner a compelling investment in today’s markets:

#### 1. Store of Wealth
For over five thousand years, precious stones have served as portable concentrated stores of value. Their small size compared to its value makes them ideal for wealth preservation across generations and borders

#### 2. Inflation Hedge 
Similar to gold, gemstones retain and most often go up in value, outpacing inflation. Scarcity, slow replenishment and rising global demand underpin consistent appreciation. 

#### 3. Historic Returns & Resilience
The ‘Big Three’ coloured stones have recorded appreciation above the average 5–10% annually in investment-grade segments. Exceptional stones in niche categories have multiplied in value many times over decades, surpassing returns from traditional asset classes.

#### 4. Portfolio Diversification
Gemstones are largely uncorrelated to traditional markets of equities, bonds, or real estate. They show incredible resilience in times of crisis, as seen through the ’08 financial collapse or COVID-19 and various wars waged over the past few years. Withstanding all the shocks, Gemstone markets have continued to grow along with its exports and valuations. Proving their stability through wars, recessions, and currency devaluations, gemstones have become incredibly attractive in constructing risk-adjusted portfolios. Their intrinsic value has shown great endurance and consistent long-term appreciation even in times when liquidity has shrunk.

#### 5. Untapped Potential
Relative to gold or equities, gemstones remain under-owned and under-traded. The limited institutional participation opens a major area for reprising as access improves. As modern market infrastructure improves, the liquidity will deepen and gemstones will be well-positioned for an asymmetrical upside.

While this makes a compelling case for the value of coloured gemstones as an investment, to unlock broader market participation, there are 3 main problems that have to be first addressed.  
### Problem Statement
Despite their intrinsic value and resilience against macroeconomic events, gemstones remain difficult to treat as a mainstream investable asset. Three structural frictions systematically limit participation and prevent price discovery, keeping gemstones an opaque, high-cost market: 

#### High Exposure Barrier
•	Exclusivity of Supply & Ownership: Historically, gemstones that can be classified as investment-grade have been circulated within a closed ecosystem of dealers, connoisseurs and private collectors. Even if the prevailing concentration maintains the scarcity, it significantly limits the buyer pool. Consequently, the limited demand base creates high search and transaction costs for both buyers and sellers. Hence, market participation becomes inefficient and often prohibitive.

•	High Ticket Size: Unlike gold, investment-grade coloured stones become attractive only beyond certain weights and quality thresholds (usually, 1-2+ carats and premium colour/clarity or stones above $5000 intrinsic value). The substantial upfront capital immediately excludes a massive segment of investors. 

•	Niche Market Dynamics: Gemstones are heterogeneous unlike fungible commodities, denoting that each stone’s value is idiosyncratic with it being based on various factors such as origin, cut, color, provenance etc.  This specialization proves to be a big impediment for retail and institutional investors as it requires expertise and access to credible networks. 
The combined effects of these make gemstones an inaccessible asset to most investors, inefficient to trade at scale and resistant to institutional productization.  

#### Lack of Transparency 
•	Authentication and Grading Uncertainty: As coloured gemstones need to be graded by trusted third-parties such as GIA, IGI, HRD, etc., for accurate valuation, it opens the door for inconsistent standards, subjective judgments on color/clarity and authenticity risks. Fraud, misrepresentation and provenance gaps inherently raise due-diligence costs.

•	Custody: Gemstones require secure storage facilities, insured custody and verifiable chain-of-title. Physical transportation across borders bring on regulatory, tax and customs complexity. These are all expensive and operationally burdensome.

•	Limited Market Data: Coloured gemstones lack universal price feeds or any central index. Pricing is derived from private deals, auction results and dealer quotes. The data is fragmented and hinders reliable mark-to-market valuation. 
With high transaction costs, elevated counterparty risks and expensive custody, market participation in gemstones dwindles down to the 0.001% of investors. 

#### Insufficient Liquidity 
•	Absence of Continuous Secondary Markets: Gemstone trading majorly takes place through private sales, auctions and dealer networks. There is no widely adopted regulated exchange offering continuous order books, standardized contracts or transparent market for coloured gemstones. Without liquid, transparent trading infrastructure, gemstones cannot serve as collateral or integrate into broader financial markets as securitized exchange-traded products. This leaves the entire asset class underutilized despite their intrinsic value. 

Yet, an asset class burgeoned with all these challenges is poised to break free with advancements in digital finance. 
This evolution can enable investment-grade gemstones to be as accessible and tradable as any modern asset, bridging centuries –old scarcity with cutting edge infrastructure. Paving the way for a new era in trading and finance, gemstones can finally move from being a niche store of wealth to liquid, transparent and democratized investment class.

### Gemstones as Digital Commodities: A New Era of Investing 

Structural and systemic barriers that have limited gemstones from mainstream finance are at the brink of being dismantled through digital infrastructure. By merging timeless rarity of investment-grade gemstones with the transparency and accessibility of modern technology and finance, gemstones as digital commodities will unlock a whole new asset class for people everywhere to participate in history’s oldest store of wealth.

#### Turning Gems into Secure Investment Vehicles
When carefully curated investment-grade gemstones are independently appraised and wrapped into its own secure investment vehicle (SPV), it creates a structure that ensures 

- Clarity of ownership 

- Verifiable provenance and 

- Robust compliance, right from the outset.  

Custody of these Gems would remain in world-class vaults located in Geneva, Dubai, Singapore, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, with comprehensive insurance coverage that vouches against all conceivable risks.

#### Fractional Ownership
Once wrapped and hence digitized, instead of requiring high upfront capital, investors can acquire fractional ownership of exceptional stones. This opens access to a far broader investor base while preserving scarcity of the underlying asset. A private collector’s ruby or emerald that is worth several millions can now be shared, enabling everyday investors to gain exposure without outright purchase.

#### Secondary Marketplaces
Establishing secondary marketplaces will allow fractional shares to be traded seamlessly. Investors will be able to enter and exit positions at any time, rebalance portfolios and benefit from transparent and continuous price discovery. For the first time, gemstones will gain the liquidity of modern financial instruments while retaining their inherent scarcity.

#### Transparent, Real-Time Portfolio Tracking
By revolutionizing gemstones as digital commodities, investors will have access to a platform that offers:

•	Real time portfolio tracking

•	Transparent performance analytics

•	Full documentation of provenance, grading, custody, and insurance

Transforming gemstones into digital commodities can be enabled by blockchain infrastructure. While the technology need not be understood in detail by every investor, its impact will be felt directly. This technology would beget autonomous verifications, tamper-proof provenance records and trustless transactions without the need for intermediaries.

#### Institutional-grade Trust at Digital Scale
Every gemstone will be independently appraised by global leaders, provenance-tracked completely from source to vault ensuring that the stones are ethically sourced. By wrapping these assets into transparent, on-chain vehicles, the gemstone market evolves from opaque and exclusive to open, liquid and institutionally investable.

### Global Forecast

The global gemstone market is predicted to rise from USD 36 Billion in 2025 to USD 68.1Billion by 2035, reflecting a robust expansion and healthy CAGR of 6.6%. A convergence of various factors will drive the growth including: 

- increasing demand for bespoke and colored gemstone jewelry,

- rising disposable incomes in both developed and emerging markets, and 

- a growing recognition of gemstones as resilient investment assets.

The per capita spending on luxury gemstones is projected to remain strong in developed countries such as the U.S, Japan and Germany supported by leading brands and heightened awareness of provenance & certification. Meanwhile, emerging markets like India, China and Brazil will see a boost in demand rooted in cultural significance, astrological traditions and deepening middle-class affluence. 

Leading exporters such as India, Thailand, and Sri Lanka will continue to shape the trade landscape in the coming decade while major hubs such as Hong Kong, UAE and Belgium will anchor global re-export and auction activity.

Technological advancements in digital platforms and infrastructure will be the defining force that enhances accessibility, transparency and consumer mindset. This will accelerate the growth of gemstones unlike ever before. 
With steady demand, broadening consumer base and increasing adoption as an alternative investment class, gemstones will solidify their role not only as cultural treasures but also as essential components of modern financial portfolios over the next decade.

## Final Words

A paradigm shift in Gemstone investing lies ahead. They move beyond ornamental value into the realm of mainstream finance. As transparent and efficient on-chain investment vehicles, gemstones will transform into digital commodities that are appraised, insured, securely vaulted, and fractionally owned along with seamless secondary trading. 

The market for precious stones is set to nearly double by 2035 with demand rising across both tradition-rich and tech-driven economies. Gemstones as an asset class will no longer be confined to only connoisseurs and collector but will be unlocked to the everyday investor. The evolution into a modern, liquid asset class bridges timeless cultural heritage with future-ready financial innovation, placing gemstones at the cusp of a transformative revaluation.
