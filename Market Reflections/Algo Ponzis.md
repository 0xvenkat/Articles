## Introduction
Ponzi schemes have been around before the advent of the internet. 
These duping schemes are cockroaches; they always find a way to thrive in new environments. 
With the innovation of blockchain tech, these schemes run rampant, ordained with the unnecessary prefix of ‘smart’ like everyday machines.

It may sound like an oxymoron, but ‘Smart Ponzis’ have sprung to life thanks to smart contracts and automated bots. 
We’re not talking about crypto at large, but a niche corner where early adopters are automatically rewarded with funds from those who jump in later. Welcome to the new world of Algorithm Ponzis.

#### Disclaimer
Nothing in this article is financial advice. The tickers mentioned are meant to give an idea into the narrative and nothing more. Use this article as a guide to understand the new types of Ponzis- either to stay away from them, or go balls deep gambling away your college fund. It’s up to you. Always DYOR. Never blame anyone but yourself, if and when you lose in the casino. 



#### TLDR; 
Crypto, specifically Solana, has unleashed a new beast in Ponzis with automated bots and smart contracts at the helm. From onchain Powerball lotteries to airdropping rewards to holders, Algo Ponzis are getting more creative than a 5year old with a crayon. These are destined to be nuked. However, if you find yourself early, you can ride the wave and make a quick buck.

## Understanding Ponzis
If Charles Ponzi were to be alive today, he would realize how far humanity has taken his initial con since the 1920s of promising dubious postage-stamp profits. The scam that bears his name, might’ve matured creatively over time, however the underlying principle remains the same: pay early participants with the money from the later ones, wrap it up in a story so good it can’t be ignored and once the scheme hits escape velocity, pull the plug bringing the entire house of cards down. 

Fast-forward through history and we see how the same formula has worn various disguises.
The Bernie Madoff’s multi-billion dollar fraud in the 2000s, where he bamboozled Wall Street elites with fake hedge fund returns.
Then came the internet, turning such schemes into digital hydras. From email chains that promised Nigerian prince fortunes, pyramid MLMs parading as “home businesses” to sketchy investment sites that vanished overnight with no trace; the internet fueled and supercharged Ponzis, making it easier to con globally with absolute anonymity.

In the 2010s Crypto enters the chat and all the bloodhounds are released. With the ease of decentralized ledgers, ‘trustless’ systems, anonymous wallets and 24/7 cycles, it suddenly became effortless to spin up the promise of riches.  

Earlier Crypto Ponzis were almost charming in their simplicity. 
Around 2011 Bitcoin Savings Trust offered weekly 7% returns, alleged through ‘secret’ trading strategies. In reality, Trendon Shavers was recycling deposits, ultimately hoarding over 700,000BTC before the SEC shut it down in 2013. 

By mid-decade, things got even bolder with the infamous Bitconnect, a meme-fueled lending platform touting 40% monthly gains from a mystical “trading bot.” Aided by YouTube hype and its own BCC token, it peaked at a $3.5Billion market cap before collapsing to dust in 2018.

Ethereum changed the game with Ponzis coded into smart contracts with the likeness of Eth-Waterfall and Forsage. Many started experimenting with ‘self-sustaining’ dApps, where buy-ins funded payouts in a never-ending Ponzi loop. 

Towards the end of the decade, blockchains like Solana significantly lowered the barrier to issuing tokens and NFTs. Ponzinomics blended right in with legit projects making it almost indistinguishable. These new wave Ponzis became algorithmic, self-operating, meme-supercharged machines built onchain; proliferating at speeds that would leave even cunning old Charles completely petrified.


### A New Era: Algo Ponzis
Early Ponzis onchain were high school plays in comparison to the full-blown Broadway productions of this new wave. These are scripted in Solidity and executed at light speed. 

Algorithmic Ponzis aren’t just memecoins with a catchy tickers and an army of shillers. They are self-operating schemes hard wired onchain. Memecoins do share the same DNA as Algo Ponzis, where early adopters make bank dumping on the late buyers. However, memecoins are only powered by a single engine of virality. There are no real mechanics behind it, mere speculative vaporware. 

Algo Ponzis by contrast have smart mechanics like automated payouts, rewards with airdrops and buy back & burn cycles. The plumbing here is more intricate, where a code-driven treadmill continues to run long enough to give the sustainable facade. These new species conceal Ponzinomics, wrap it in memes and run on autopilot. All until the team behind it pull the plug. 

Let’s unpack the various types of Algo Ponzis dominating the scene today: 

#### Type 1: Lottery / Raffle Coins
A jackpot-driven type of Algo Ponzi that gamifies buying & holding the coin for periodic payouts. 
While they look playful on the surface, they are the purest form of Ponzis onchain. 

Mechanics: 
 - Entry: Buy the token or maintain a threshold balance (10k coins etc.) to qualify for the draw. Lotteries often require you to burn or lock tokens for tickets, however raffles reward by simply holding.  
- Funding: Prize pools are juiced with buy/sell taxes, trading fees or inflows from new participants. Every trade feeds the pot. 
- Randomization: Automated randomizers pick the winning wallet, with draws triggered by time or prize.      
- Payouts: Smart contracts automatically get triggered to instantly distribute rewards to the winners. 

Examples of Lottery / Raffle coins
$LOTTO on ETH deducts ~1 % of balances weekly and hands the stash to one lucky wallet
$LOT on Base uses trade fees to fund prize pools for eligible holders
$Tonzo on TON is a telegram integrated raffle with $5 tickets and $20M weekly pots.

I’m refraining from mentioning the copious number of these found on Sol, as these might just invariably rug before this article is even published. Which brings me to the Ponzi aspect. 
These might seem transparent with no real operator, just code and easily accessible. Yet their sustainability completely hinges on volume. When new money or active trading dries up, jackpots shrink and liquidity evaporates. Leaving you with a token whose value tanks and no the liquidity for any payouts. 


#### TYPE 2: Reflection Coins
These tokens blur the line between Ponzi and Pyramid schemes by enticing holders with a share of the revenue generated as rewards. They turn token HODLing into a reward loop. It’s similar to earning dividends in tradfi, but onchain.

Unlike legitimate cases where protocols and chains airdrop native coins to those who stake and provide early support, these Algo Ponzis don’t require locking up of any tokens or even performing actions with the project. You just need to hold. This makes the Ponzi - Pyramid extremely seductive.

Mechanics:
- Eligibility & Holding Requirement: To receive rewards, one must hold the token at the time of wallet snapshot, which usually occurs right before distribution. Sometimes holding the token also gives you “points” or “share weight” for receiving future drops.
- Funding: A share of transaction fees are diverted to a reward pool. New token inflows could also partly be used to finance rewards. Sometimes even partnership or “sponsored” token drops take place where other projects pay for access to the holder base.

- Distribution: Rewards are distributed at fixed intervals or when certain conditions are met, such as the reward pool reaching a certain amount. Airdrops are sent based on the size of the Ponzi tokens held in the wallet. Smart contracts and automated bots handle the collection of fees, calculation of holder balances and execution of the airdrops. All this is majorly done without manual interference. 

Examples of Holder Airdrop Rewards
$SAFE on BNB: Safemoon was the Pioneer of Algo Ponzis where a 10% tax redistributed tokens to holders, burning the supply and funding liquidity. 
$IMG on SOL: Infinite Money Glitch rewards holders with Sol accumulated through a 5% buy/sell tax every few minutes.  

$MUG on Sol: Mug pays out USDC rewards to holders every 5 minutes funded by transaction fees. 
$xStocks on Sol: This project rewarded holders with randomized tokenized stocks at market close daily, funded majorly through taxes and new inflows.

Reflection tokens embody the motto of “just hold and get free tokens”.   Remember when something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. These types of Algo Ponzis mimic yield or dividend like income, but the yield comes from fees generated by other participants rather from utility or product. They completely rely on new buyers and transactions to keep their promise of rewards. The moment this stops, the system fails. And again you’re left with worthless tokens which can’t keep the promise of rewards as the pool has dried up. 


#### Type 3: Deflationary Treasury Buyback and Burn Coins
These tokens engineer a deflationary spine that uses a portion of onchain revenue (whether trading fees, taxes or a dedicated ‘buyback reserve’)  to repurchase its own token from the market and burn it, shrinking supply and theoretically lifting market value.

The mechanism is simple: Fees fund the  Treasury/ Buyback Reserve →  Automated buybacks (carried out via smart contracts or bots) → Market buys the token on DEXs, → Removes supply by sending them to burn address or locks them up. 

Smart contracts and automated bots may have seductive twists such as timed burns or treasury allocations. But since there isn’t sustainable revenue beyond the tax/ fees treadmill, the model remains a Ponzi wearing a deflationary costume.

Examples of Buyback and Burn coins:
- $DUSD on Sol: launched via pump.fun, it uses 100% of creator fees for automated buybacks and burns every minute. Pitched under a “deflationary USD” stablecoin narrative, but relies on constant trades for ongoing burns. 

- $BNBBURN on BNB: Applies taxes on every transaction to fund direct buybacks, and then burns the tokens, creating "never-ending deflationary pressure" and "astronomical buy pressure". It's a pure tax-to-burn loop aimed at perpetual scarcity.


The optics might look sleek with clean dashboards that track supply burn and increase in Mcap. However, these Algo Ponzis again hinges on relentless volume flowing into the token. When traders cool off, the buybacks dry up and the deflationary coin isn’t very deflationary anymore.  Once demand/ interest in the coin start to fall, it nukes the price support. 
The Ponzinomics at its core becomes evident leaving the late buyers with worthless bags.


### Final Words: Play the Game, Don’t Marry it
As you’ve read, from lottery-style raffles to airdrop fueled pyramids and slick buyback and burn tokens, Algo Ponzis are diverse and pervasive. Yet they all share the same core principle: they live only as long as new money flows in. 
Most are best left untouched, the math is rigged and the house always wins. That being said now that you understand the main species that run rampant, you’re well equipped to spot early trends.
 If you’re nimble (and lucky) enough to catch the next one before it takes off, you might be able to squeeze out some short-term passive income before the music stops.

Remember- “Be early, take profits, and never believe the story more than the math”, & “P is P my G!”
