# How Game-Fi will Propel Web3

The archaic business model of the gaming sector has long needed a shift from the one-way street of developers and publishers owning all content related to the game. 
The psychology of gaming has evolved. Players want a bigger role in the games they play and want to be rewarded for the time spent in-game. 
The industry is hurriedly catching up with this sentiment through the help of ‘Game-fi’ developed on the revolutionary architecture of blockchains. 

‘Game-fi’, a portmanteau of gaming and finance, has garnered the most attention in Web3 and rightfully so. All the hype around pixel art and monkey jpegs can be rooted to their future use cases in-game. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is highly bullish on the metaverse which cannot be successful without the implementation of Game-fi. Even if they claim gaming as just a part of the bigger metaverse ideology, disregarding a sector valued closely around $200 billion USD (as of 2021) is something that would be categorised as downright absurd. 

Game-fi will expedite the mainstream Web3 adoption. Here’s how:

Until recently, games ran on centralised servers where developers and publishers retained all rights to the game and its content. 
While gamers spend inconceivable time and effort acquiring digital items in-game, their efforts never seemed to be compensated without true ownership over these items.  This is all set to change with the help of Web 3.0 & Game-fi. 

Game-Fi entwines blockchain technology and game mechanics to allow gamers to accrue value in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 
Blockchains through its open ledger provide transparency, immutability and security that records and verifies ownership of the digital assets. 
Gamers across the world have witnessed this transition of the industry from Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 through the introduction of the Play-2-Earn (P2E) model.

This economic model provides players with the opportunity of monetising their time spent playing the game. 
The game rewards its users with NFTs with game advancement and gameplay (sidequests, challenges etc.). 
The lucrative aspect of these NFTs arise from the ability to exchange them for cryptocurrencies that can then be traded for fiat on third-party exchanges. 
The possibility of earning money helps retain an active player participation in these games. P2E games have had a massive rise in popularity since the global pandemic in 2020. 

Play-2-Earn games set up their own virtual economies. Most games have their own unique cryptocurrencies anchored on top of blockchains of popular cryptocurrencies (often Solana, Ethereum or its layer-2’s such as Polygon) with a changing range of token supply and demand (tokenomics). Each game’s model and economy differ, however it's universal that in-game items have the potential to give players financial benefits. NFTs or digital tokens represent all the products available in-game. They serve as proof of owning intangible assets, for example- virtual land plots, avatars, outfits, tools, gold, and  various such items. Just as any economy, the rarer the item, the more potential for profitability. 

The trading of in-game assets has been a feature of games for over 20 years. Where Game-Fi differs from traditional gaming is its ability to facilitate the trading of such items in a safe and secure way as all transaction data of the NFTs and Cryptocurrencies are publicly maintained on blockchains. As a distributed public ledger keeps a digital record, it becomes fairly easy to track the possessions of each player. There are innumerable advantages of the gaming industry utilizing this technology. The biggest benefit comes for gamers through trustless ownership of in-game assets. While trading such assets, gamers will not require any middleman for custody, authentication or settlements. Even if the underlying publisher of the game faces technological problems, gamers do not need to fear their assets being lost, taken away or copied. 

The promise of total ownership of in-game assets has had a massive effect on the gaming industry, edging the old economic structure of in-app purchases & advertising obsolete. As Blockchain games allow the use of in-game items outside the game, it has compelled a change in ideology. Whenever blockchain enters a sector, so does decentralisation and autonomous governance along with it. This radical change supremely benefits gamers. And it is to no surprise that gamers will embrace this change with open arms. Consequently this would expedite the mainstream adoption of Web3, which is currently dominated by niche financial instruments and thousands of dollars worth of jpegs. Once Game-Fi becomes synonymous with gamers worldwide, Web3 will reach unprecedented heights.
