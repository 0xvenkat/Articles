# The First Mooner: Where It All Began
Everyone has that one project,  the one that flipped their switch and made them an onchain degenerate. 
Where the r/r was absurd but somehow, it absolutely cooked. 
It was the start of something deeper, a wild ride through the trenches hunting gems. 
You never forget your first mooner.

Sometimes I find myself revisiting that project. You know, the one that made me smile for the first time in crypto. 
Its volume now a shadow of its former self, the market cap nowhere near those all-time highs. 
But I still check up on the team every once in a while- spectating- watching them trying to please the new bag holders. 
It’s a ritual of sorts, sleepless nights glued to charts, dropping endless gifs in group chats, and raiding posts with the clan.

Those god candle days made it all worthwhile. We never forget our first. 

Sure, the new holders might need a little coaxing, but the real ones who’ve stayed through the highs and lows? 
There’s a brotherhood there - a rare loyalty you don’t often find across TCP/IP connections. 

And as we near the peak of this cycle, the trenches have morphed into a brutal PvP battleground, dripping with toxicity and endless grinds for scraps.
But it wasn’t always this way.

Back when memecoins and NFTs first exploded, it was about community, creating something cool, where sticking together meant everyone won. 
Onboarding new people was about inclusivity, not finding exit liquidity. Fast forward to today, and greed and grifters rule the game, turning this once-vibrant space into a reflection of the internet’s darkest corners.

Yet when I think back to those early winners, I remember why we started. We began our journey to be a part of the coolest corner of the internet. 
A place where tech evolved at lightspeed, news and memes were one and the same, and only degenerates brave enough to take wild chances made it big.

If we want crypto to thrive, we need to reclaim that spirit. The only way to bring normies onchain is by ditching the current vamp mentality and championing what crypto was always about: community and decentralization. 

That’s the path forward, and maybe it’s time we all remember our first mooner to lead the way.
